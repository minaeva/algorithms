/**
 * A Least Recently Used (LRU) cache is a type of cache that evicts the 'least recently used items'
 * when there is a need to constrain its size.
 *
 * For this particular implementation, the size constraint is set at CacheLimits.maxItemsCount.
 * An item is considered accessed whenever `get`, or `set` methods are called with its key.
 *
 * This LRU cache will achieve size constraint by checking the cache size at the time of each new insertion.
 * In the case where the cache has reached its limit, the item least recently accessed will be removed.
 * This removal process will not happen on a separate thread but in the caller's thread,
 * thus potentially blocking their return for a cleanup when deemed necessary.
 *
 * Use the provided com.speechify.LRUCacheProviderTest in `src/test/java/LruCacheTest.java` to validate your
 * implementation.
 *
 * You may:
 *  - Read online API references for Java standard library or JVM collections.
 * You must not:
 *  - Read guides about how to code an LRU cache.
